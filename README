This is a package which implements some utilities useful for modelling and 
analyzing simulation output of PDRs.

Prerequisites
=============
amuse  - mpich
PyQt4
ipython


Installing the PDR code
=======================
The PDR code should be copied into:
      amuse/src/amuse/community/pdr

Compiling the PDR code
======================
The PDR code can be compiled using:
    ~> cd amuse/src/amuse/community/pdr
    ~> make all
The generates the libpdr.a library

Setting up the working environment
==================================
The path to ismcpak should be added to the PYTHONPATH environment variable. For
bash, the following line should be added:

    export PYTHONPATH=/PATH/TO/ismcpak:$PYTHONPATH
   
to tcsh :

    setenv PYTHONPATH /PATH/TO/ismcpak:$PYTHONPATH

Running the code
================
  Basic test - single model
  -------------------------
  The PDR code can only be run through the AMUSE ( http://amusecode.org ).
  Depending on the mpi environment installed with AMUSE, it might be 
  necessary to launch the mpd deamon before executing either:
  
    ~> mpirun -np 1 python run_singleMesh.py
    
  or via
  
    ~> python run_singleMesh.py
